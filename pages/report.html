            Introduction
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            The News is a website that provides the latest news on topics such as politics, economy, technology and
            breaking news. The article content is generated by ChatGPT, a machine learning model that generates text
            based on the input. The decision to use ChatGPT was made because it allows for the creation of unique
            content instead of typical lorem ipsum text. The other option was to impelement a news API from a website
            such as RapidAPI, but that would have resulted with additional costs. The website is designed to be simple
            and easy to use, with a minimalistic design and a responsive layout. The News webiste logo is created from
            just text and CSS. The logo is made up of the letters N, E, W and S with bounding boxes around them.

        <div class="content">
            Websites includes typical HTML, CSS and JS files. The HTML files are used to structure the website and the
            first page is described in index.html file. Other pages are included in the pages folder: 404.html,
            economy.html, news.html, politics.html, reprot.html and technology.html. The CSS files are used to style the
            website and most of the styles are described in styles.css file, while report style is described in
            report.css file. The JS files are used to add functionality to the website and the main JS file is
            script.js, while utils folder holds functions with specific functionality such as fetching data from JSON.
            articles.json file in the articles directory holds all the data used in the website. I made this decision
            because it is a typical file for API to transport content to the webiste. Folder called assets includes all
            the images used in the website.

            Inspiration

        <div class="content">
            <div>I was inspired by the design I found on the internet -
                <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/18798886-News-Landing-Page">Dribbble</a>
            </div>
            <div>I was also inspired by the video about
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZleShIpv5zQ">Single Page Application</a>
                routing. However, I didn't choose to implement it because the assigment said to build website and not a
                SPA.

            <ul>
                <li>Website can be accessed by openning index.html file. That way articles.json file is not fetched
                    properly because of Cross-Origin Resource Policy.</li>
                <li>While developing I used VSCode and Live Server (Five Server) extension to access the website.</li>
                <li>All the files are also placed on my private Github repository where I can choose to publish or
                    unpublish the website. Website can be access here: https://guidogl.github.io/web-course/</li>

                    The first usability case is considered for desktop users. It can adapt to different screen sizes.

                <li>
                    The second usability case is considered for mobile users. It has a "hamburger" menu that opens when
                    on mobile.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The third usability case is considered for developers. It has a simple structure and is easy to
                    understand naming.
